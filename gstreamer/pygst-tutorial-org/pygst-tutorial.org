This tutorial aims at giving a brief introduction to the GStreamer 1.0 multimedia framework using its Python bindings.

* Meta
<<sec:meta>>

A GStreamer application is built as a directed, acyclic graph.  In the figures these graphs are illustrated with the convention:

- right solid line rectangles indicate basic GStreamer /elements/
- rounded solid line rectangles to indicate GStreamer /bins/ (and /pipelines/) subclasses of /elements/.
- rounded dashed line rectangles to indicate /pads/

* Introduction
<<sec:intro>>

This tutorial is meant to be a quick way to get to know more about GStreamer but it'll take some time to write it though because we don't know it ourselves ... yet. We're usually using GNU/Linux and GTK in the examples but we try to keep the GUI code to an absolute minimum so it should not get in the way. Just remember that GStreamer depends heavily on Glib so you must make sure that the [[https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#GLib-2.0/structs/MainLoop.html][Glib Mainloop]] is running if you want to catch events on the bus. We take for granted that you are at least a fairly descent Python coder. For problems related to the Python language we redirect you over to [[http://python.org/doc][Online Python docs]].

There are also some example coding distributed with the PyGST source which you may browse at the [[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-python/tree/examples][gst-python git repository]].  Reference documents for GStreamer and the rest of the ecosystem it relies on are available at [[https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gst-1.0][lazka's GitHub site]].  The main [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/][GStreamer]] site has [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/][Reference Manual]], [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/faq/][FAQ]], [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/manual/][Applications Development Manual]] and [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/pwg/][Plugin Writer's Guide]]. This tutorial targets the GStreamer 1.0 API which all v1.x releases should follow.  The Novacut project has a [[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Novacut/GStreamer1.0][guide to porting]] Python applications from the prior 0.1 API to 1.0.
Finally, GStreamer provides the [[http://docs.gstreamer.com/display/GstSDK/][GstSDK documentation]] which includes substantial C programming tutorials.

As you may see this tutorial is far from done and we are always looking for new people to join this project. If you want to write a chapter, fix the examples, provide alternatives or otherwise improve this document please do so.  It is suggested to [[https://github.com/brettviren/pygst-tutorial-org/][clone the repository on GitHub]] and issue a pull request.  Note, the original source of this document was [[http://developer.berlios.de/projects/pygstdocs/][here]] but is now dead.

** Command Line
<<subsec:cli>>

Before getting started with Python some of the command line interface (CLI) programs that come with GStreamer are explored.  Besides being generally useful they can help you find and try out what you need in a very fast and convenient way without writing a bit of code. With [[http://docs.gstreamer.com/display/GstSDK/gst-inspect][=gst-inspect=]] you can track highlevel elements which are shipped with the various plugins packages.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  man gst-inspect-1.0
#+END_SRC

If you are looking for an element but you don't know its name you can use it with grep. Getting the elements that handles ie mp3 is done like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output text :exports both
  gst-inspect-1.0 | grep mp3 | sort | head -3
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: flump3dec:  flump3dec: Fluendo MP3 Decoder (liboil build)
: lame:  lamemp3enc: L.A.M.E. mp3 encoder
: libav:  avdec_mp3adufloat: libav ADU (Application Data Unit) MP3 (MPEG audio layer 3) decoder

The [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-playbin.html][=playbin=]] element is an autoplugger which usually plays anything you throw at it, if you have the appropriate plugins installed.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results none :exports code
   gst-inspect-1.0 playbin > gst-inspect-playbin.txt
#+END_SRC

Browse example output [[./gst-inspect-playbin.txt][here]]. 

You can also run pipelines directly in a terminal with [[http://docs.gstreamer.com/display/GstSDK/gst-launch][=gst-launch=]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  man gst-launch-1.0
#+END_SRC

For playing a file with playbin:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  gst-launch-1.0 playbin \
      uri=http://docs.gstreamer.com/media/sintel_trailer-480p.webm
#+END_SRC

It's also possible to link elements together with "!":

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  gst-launch-1.0 audiotestsrc ! alsasink
#+END_SRC

You may also make different streams in the pipeline:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  gst-launch-1.0 audiotestsrc ! alsasink videotestsrc ! xvimagesink
#+END_SRC

Or, you can make a single frame JPEG

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results none :exports code
  gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc num-buffers=1 ! jpegenc ! \
    filesink location=videotestsrc-frame.jpg
#+END_SRC

[[./videotestsrc-frame.jpg]]

If you are using the "name" property you may use the same element more than once. Just put a "." after its name, eg with oggmux here.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  gst-launch-1.0 audiotestsrc ! vorbisenc ! oggmux name=mux ! \
    filesink location=file.ogg videotestsrc ! theoraenc ! mux.
#+END_SRC

In the next chapter we will show you more examples with Playbin.

* Playbin
<<sec:playbin>>

The [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-playbin.html][=playbin=]] element was exercised from the command line in section [[subsec:cli]] and in this section it will be used from Python.  It is a high-level, automatic audio and video player. You create a =playbin= object with:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :exports both
  import gi
  gi.require_version('Gst', '1.0')
  from gi.repository import Gst
  Gst.init(None)
  # ...
  my_playbin = Gst.ElementFactory.make("playbin", None)
  assert my_playbin
  print my_playbin
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: <__main__.GstPlayBin object at 0x7fd8e88e6aa0 (GstPlayBin at 0x1c0cf00)>

To get information about a playbin run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  gst-inspect-0.10 playbin
#+END_SRC

This figure shows how playbin is built internally. The "optional stuff" are things that could be platform specific or things that you may set with properties.

The "*uri*" property should take any possible protocol supported by your GStreamer plugins. One nice feature is that you may switch the sinks out for your own bins as shown below. Playbin always tries to set up the best possible pipeline for your specific environment so if you don't need any special features that are not implemented in playbin, it should in most cases just work "out of the box". Ok, time for a few examples.

** Audio with Playbin
<<subsec:playbinaudio>>

This first example is just a simple audio player, insert a file with absolute path and it'll play.  It's code is listed below.  You can run it like:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  python playbin-example-audio.py
#+END_SRC

It will open a small window with a text entry.  Enter the full path to some audio file and click "Start".

#+HTML: <a href="playbin-example-audio.py">playbin-example-audio.py</a>
#+INCLUDE: playbin-example-audio.py src python

** Adding Video 
<<subsec:playbinvideo>>

A =playbin= plugs both audio and video streams automagically and the =videosink= has been switched out to a =fakesink= element which is GStreamer's answer to directing output to =/dev/null=. If you want to enable video playback just comment out the following lines:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :eval no
  fakesink = Gst.ElementFactory.make("fakesink", "fakesink")
  self.player.set_property("video-sink", fakesink)
#+END_SRC

If you want to show the video output in a specified window you'll have to use the [[https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gst-1.0/classes/Bus.html#Gst.Bus.enable_sync_message_emission][=enable_sync_message_emission()=]] method on the bus. Here is an example with the video window embedded in the program.

#+HTML: <a href="playbin-example-video.py">playbin-example-video.py</a>
#+INCLUDE: playbin-example-video.py src python

And just to make things a little more complicated you can switch the =playbin='s video sink to a {{{gstclass(Bin)}}} with a {{{gstclass(GhostPad)}}} on it. Here's an example with a [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-timeoverlay.html][=timeoverlay=]].

#+BEGIN_SRC python :eval no
  bin = Gst.Bin.new("my-bin")
  timeoverlay = Gst.ElementFactory.make("timeoverlay")
  bin.add(timeoverlay)
  pad = timeoverlay.get_static_pad("video_sink")
  ghostpad = Gst.GhostPad.new("sink", pad)
  bin.add_pad(ghostpad)
  videosink = Gst.ElementFactory.make("autovideosink")
  bin.add(videosink)
  timeoverlay.link(videosink)
  self.player.set_property("video-sink", bin)
#+END_SRC

Add that code to the example above and you'll get a =timeoverlay= too. We'll talk more about [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/manual/html/section-pads-ghost.html]["ghost pads"]] later.

Here now adds a CLI example which plays music.  It can be run it with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  python cliplayer.py /path/to/file1.mp3 /path/to/file2.ogg
#+END_SRC

#+HTML: <a href="playbin-example-cliplayer.py">playbin-example-cliplayer.py</a>
#+INCLUDE: playbin-example-cliplayer.py src python

A =playbin= implements a {{{gstclass(Pipeline)}}} element and that's what the next chapter is going to tell you more about.

* Pipeline
<<sec:pipeline>>

A {{{gstclass(Pipeline)}}} is a top-level bin with its own bus and clock. If your program only contains one /bin/-like object, this is what you're looking for. You create a pipeline object with:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :eval no
  my_pipeline = Gst.Pipeline.new("my-pipeline")
#+END_SRC

A pipeline is a "container" where you can put other objects and when everything is in place and the file to play is specified you set the pipeline's state to [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstBin.html#GstBin.notes][=Gst.State.PLAYING=]] and there should be multimedia coming out of it.

** Pipeline Audio Player

The first example here starts with the audio player from section [[sec:playbin]] and switches the =playbin= for the =mad= decoding pipeline that is capable of handling MP3 streams.  Before coding it in Python it can be tested using =gst-launch=.  

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=file.mp3 ! mad ! audioconvert ! alsasink
#+END_SRC

Conceptually this pipeline looks like:

#+header: :file (by-backend (latex "pipeline-block.pdf") (t "pipeline-block.svg"))
#+BEGIN_SRC ditaa
    
                                 Example Gst.Pipeline 
    
           /---------------------------------------------------------------------\
           |   +---------+     +-------+     +--------------+     +----------+   |
           |   |         |     |       |     |              |     |          |   |
  file.mp3--->-| filesrc +-->--+  mad  +-->--+ audioconvert +-->--+ alsasink +---->-Audio Output
           |   |         |     |       |     |              |     |          |   |
           |   +---------+     +-------+     +--------------+     +----------+   |
           \---------------------------------------------------------------------/
#+END_SRC

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
#+RESULTS:
[[file:pipeline-block.svg]]

Done in Python this would look like =pipeline-example.py=:

#+HTML: <a href="pipeline-example.py">pipeline-example.py</a>
#+INCLUDE: pipeline-example.py src python

** Adding Video to the Pipeline

The next example is playing MPEG2 videos. Some demuxers, such as =mpegdemux=, uses dynamic pads which are created at runtime and therefor you can't link between the demuxer and the next element in the pipeline before the pad has been created at runtime. Watch out for the =demuxer_callback()= method below.

#+header: :file (by-backend (latex "pipeline-branch-block.pdf") (t "pipeline-branch-block.svg"))
#+BEGIN_SRC ditaa

The elements in a pipeline connects to each other with pads and that's what the next chapter will tell you more about.

* Src, sink, pad ... oh my!
<<sec:srcsinkpad>>

As their names imply, a /src/ is an object that is "sending" data and a /sink/ is an object that is "receiving" data. These objects connect to each other with /pads/. Pads could be either /src/ or /sink/. Most elements have both /src/ and /sink/ pads. For example, the =mad= MP3 decoder element looks something like the figure below:


#+header: :file (by-backend (latex "sink-src-block.pdf") (t "sink-src-block.svg"))
#+BEGIN_SRC ditaa
                                    mad element

And as always if you want to know more about highlevel elements gst-inspect is your friend:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  gst-inspect-1.0 mad
#+END_SRC

In particular, the inheritance diagram shows that =mad= is an element:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
GObject
 +----GInitiallyUnowned
       +----GstObject
             +----GstElement
                   +----GstAudioDecoder
                         +----GstMad
#+END_EXAMPLE 

There are many different ways to link elements together. In =pipeline-example.py= we used the =Gst.Pipeline.add()= and the =.link()= method of the produced elements. You can also make a completely ready-to-go pipeline with the =parse_launch()= function. The many =.add()= calls in that example can be rewritten as:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :eval no
  mp3_pipeline = Gst.parse_launch("filesrc name=source ! mad name=decoder ! " \
                                  "audioconvert name=conv ! alsasink name=sink")
#+END_SRC

The micro-language used in this function call is that of the =gst-launch= command line program.

When you do manually link pads with the =.link()= method make sure that you link a /src/-pad to a /sink/-pad. No rule though without exceptions. A {{{gstclass(GhostPad)}}} should be linked to a pad of the same kind as itself. We have already showed how a ghost pad works in the addition to example 2.2. A [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstBin.html][=Gst.Bin=]] can't link to other objects if you don't link a [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstGhostPad.html][=Gst.GhostPad=]] to an element inside the bin. The =playbin-example-video.py= example in section [[sec:playbin]]  should look something like this:

#+header: :file (by-backend (latex "playbin-pads-block.pdf") (t "playbin-pads-block.svg"))

And the ghostpad above should be created as type "sink"!!!

Some pads are not always available and are only created when they are in use. Such pads are called "dynamical pads". The next example will show how to use dynamically created pads with an [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-oggdemux.html][=oggdemux=]]. The link between the demuxer and the decoder is created with the =demuxer_callback()= method, which is called whenever a pad is created in the demuxer using the "=pad-added=" signal.

Now after reading through these four chapters you could need a break. Happy hacking and stay tuned for more interesting chapters to come.

*  Seeking
<<sec:seeking>>

Seeking in GStreamer is done with the [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#gst-element-seek][=seek()=]] and [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#gst-element-seek-simple][=seek_simple()=]] methods of {{{gstclass(Element)}}}. 
To be able to seek you will also need to tell GStreamer what kind of seek it should do. In the following example we will use a [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstInfo.html#GST-TIME-FORMAT:CAPS][=TIME= value]] (of {{{gstenum(Format)}}} enum) format constant which will, as you may guess, request a time seek. We will also use the [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#gst-element-query-duration][=query_duration()=]] and [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#gst-element-query-position][=query_position()=]] methods to get the file length and how long the file has currently played. GStreamer uses nanoseconds by default so you have to adjust to that.

In this next example we take the Vorbis-Player from example 4.1 and update it with some more stuff so it's able to seek and show duration and position.

* Capabilities
<<sec:caps>>

Capabilities, {{{gststruct(Caps)}}}, is a container where you may store information that you may pass on to a {{{gstclass(PadTemplate)}}}. When you set the pipeline state to either playing or paused the elements pads negotiates what caps to use for the stream. Now the following pipeline works perfectly:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  gst-launch-1.0  videotestsrc ! video/x-raw, width=320, height=240 ! \
    xvimagesink
#+END_SRC

But if you try to switch out the [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-xvimagesink.html][=xvimagesink=]] for an [[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-ximagesink.html][=ximagesink=]] you will notice that it wouldn't work. That's because =ximagesink= can't handle =video/x-raw= so you must put in an element BEFORE in the pipeline that does.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  gst-launch-1.0  videotestsrc ! video/x-raw, width=320, height=240 ! \
    videoconvert ! ximagesink
#+END_SRC

And as =ximagesink= does not support hardware scaling you have to throw in a =videoscale= element too if you want software scaling.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  gst-launch-1.0  videotestsrc ! video/x-raw, width=320, height=240 ! \
    videoscale ! videoconvert ! ximagesink
#+END_SRC

To put the above examples in code you have to put the caps in a capsfilter element.

#+HTML: <a href="capabilities-example.py">capabilities-example.py</a>
#+INCLUDE: capabilities-example.py src python

A frequently asked question is how to find out what resolution a file has and one way to do it is to check the caps on a decodebin element in paused state.

#+HTML: <a href="capabilities-resolution-example.py">capabilities-resolution-example.py</a>
#+INCLUDE: capabilities-resolution-example.py src python

In the next example we will use the =playbin= from section [[subsec:playbinvideo]] and switch its video-sink out for our own homemade bin filled with some elements. Now, let's say that you run a tv-station and you want to have your logo in the top right corner of the screen. For that you can use a =textoverlay= but for the fonts to be the exact same size on the screen no matter what kind of resolution the source has you have to specify a width so everything is scaled according to that.

#+INCLUDE: capabilities-playbin-example.py src python

* Videomixer
<<sec:vidmix>>

The =videomixer= element makes it possible to mix different video streams together. Here is a CLI example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=tvlogo.png ! pngdec ! alphacolor ! \
    videoconvert ! videobox border-alpha=0 alpha=0.5 top=-20 left=-200 ! \
    videomixer name=mix ! videoconvert ! autovideosink videotestsrc ! \
    video/x-raw, width=320, height=240 ! mix.
#+END_SRC

Fixme: this fails with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Setting pipeline to PAUSED ...
Pipeline is PREROLLING ...
ERROR: from element /GstPipeline:pipeline0/GstFileSrc:filesrc0: Internal data flow error.
Additional debug info:
gstbasesrc.c(2865): gst_base_src_loop (): /GstPipeline:pipeline0/GstFileSrc:filesrc0:
streaming task paused, reason not-negotiated (-4)
ERROR: pipeline doesn't want to preroll.
Setting pipeline to NULL ...
Freeing pipeline ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

You have to make a [[./tvlogo.png][=tvlogo.png=]] image (100x100 px) to be able to run it. With the =videobox= element you can move the image around and add more alpha channels.

In the next example we take the now working Mpeg2-Player from section [[sec:pipeline]] and add the elements shown above.

Fixme: This fails with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

#+END_EXAMPLE

* Webcam Viewer
<<sec:webcam>>

Remember to peal the tape off your web cam lens before testing this.
