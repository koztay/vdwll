# PyGST Tutorial/Position, Duration, and Seeking

The next few articles focus on the notion of *time* in GStreamer. We
discuss how to determine the duration of a pipeline, and how to query
the current position. We discuss absolute and relative *seeking* modes,
and then create a video player with seeking capability. Finally we
discuss the *segment seek*, and show how we can use segment seeking to
implement looping and non-linear editing.
