# PyGST Tutorial/Acknowledgements

My thanks goes out to the following:

-   Stephen Griffiths, for pointing out that I should use `decodebin2`
    if possible.
-   Tomas Cernaj, for letting me know about the necessity of calling
    `gtk.gdk.threads_init()`, `threads_enter()` and `threads_leave()`
