# The people

This page is intended for new community members to know who to “go to”
for specific issues, as well as highlight the great work of our
contributors. You might have noticed that **some of us are connected at
all times** (using an IRC proxy such as
[bip](http://bip.milkypond.org)). Being connected does not necessarily
mean we are in front of the computer: if we have an Away status, you
need to be patient when asking questions as we might be temporarily
offline or on different timezones. We'll see your messages when we
reconnect using our IRC client.
