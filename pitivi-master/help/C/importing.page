  <title>Getting media</title>
  <p>Pitivi allows importing media files from your computer's hard drive.</p>
  <note>
    <p>When you create a new project and import the first video file, its properties are transposed to the <link xref="workwithprojects#projectsettings">project settings</link>, unless you changed them yourself already. An infobar appears when this happens. Click the <gui>Project Settings</gui> button in the infobar for details.</p>
  </note>
  <note>
    <p>Due to our limited resources and the rapid evolution of filmmaking hardware in the past few years, and to ensure <app>Pitivi</app> remains robust and simple to use, we do not attempt to support every possible hardware device out there. As a result, you currently cannot use <app>Pitivi</app> to capture directly from a camcorder; specialized applications are better suited for this task. For example, for DV/HDV camcorders using an IEEE 1394 connection, you may use <app>Kino</app> or <app>dvgrab</app> to capture footage.</p>

  <section id="filechooser">
    <title>Importing files using the file chooser</title>
    <p>You can import media into the <gui>Media Library</gui> by using the file chooser dialog, which has the advantage of letting you preview the files you want to import. To do so, use the <gui>Import</gui> button in the <gui>Media Library</gui> header.</p>
    <p>A file chooser dialog window will appear. You can press <key>Ctrl</key> or <key>Shift</key> to select multiple files at the same time.</p>

    <title>Importing files using drag and drop</title>
    <p>The concept of drag and drop is a well-established method of bridging the gap between software applications. Simply select the files you want to import in another application (such as a file manager or a multimedia app) and drag them with your mouse onto <app>Pitivi</app>'s <gui>Media Library</gui>.</p>
    <p>This feature can be used to:</p>
    <list>
      <item>
        <p>Easily import music or video clips from a media player (such as <app>Rhythmbox</app> or <app>Totem</app>).</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Allow using a full-fledged file manager (such as <app>Nautilus</app>, <app>Thunar</app>, <app>Dolphin</app> or <app>Konqueror</app>) instead of the file chooser dialog.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Import a combination of multiple files and folders at the same time.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Leverage the searching capability of another application (such as <app>GNOME Shell</app>, <app>Tracker</app>, <app>GNOME Activity Journal</app>, <app>GNOME Search Tool</app>, etc.).</p>
