#       It is created as an illustration for Chapter 7 section,
#       "Saving Video Frames as Images"
#       of the book: "Python Multimedia Applications Beginners Guide"

# Details
#-------------
#    - A utility that can take N number of still images from a streaming
#      video in a specified time frame.
#    - See 'Running the program' section below for further information.
#
# Dependencies
#---------------
#  In order to run the program the following packages need to be installed and
#  appropriate environment variables need to be set (if it is not done by the
#  installer automatically.)
# 1. Python 2.6
# 2. GStreamer 0.10.5 or later version
# 3. Python bindings for GStreamer v 0.10.15 or later
# 4. PyGObject v 2.14 or later
# 5. The following is a partial list of GStreamer plug-ins
#   that should be available in your GStreamer installation. Typically
#   these plug-ins are available by default. If not, install those.
#   ffmpegcolorspace, capsfilter,
#
# @Note:
#   You should have Python2.6 installed. The python executable
#   PATH should also be  specified as an environment variable , so that
#   "python" is a known command when run from command prompt.
#
# *Running the program:
#   Run the program in the command console as:
#
#  $python ImagesFromVideo.py [options]
#
#   Where, the [options] are:
#
#   --input_file   : The full path to input video file from which one or more
#                    frames need to be captured and saved as images.
#   --start_time   : The position in seconds on the video track. This will
#                    be the starting position from which one or more
#                    video frames will be captured as still image(s)
#                    NOTE: THE FIRST SNAPSHOT WILL ALWAYS BE AT start_time
#   --duration     : The duration (in seconds) of the video track starting
#                    from the "start_time". N number of frames will be captured
#                    starting from start time.
#   --num_of_captures: Total number of frames that need to be captured from
#                     start_time (including it) up to ,
#                     end_time= start_time + duration
#                    ( but not including the still image at end_time)
#                      NOTE: THE FIRST SNAPSHOT WILL ALWAYS BE AT start_time.
#                      so there won't be any snapshot at the end_time.You
#                      can extend this application (minor changes required)
#                      so that it also captures image at end_time
#
#    Example: Suppose you want to save 10 video frames as images, from
#    40 second to 42 seconds on the video time-line. This utility
#    will save 10 still images starting at 40 seconds,  saving image
#    after every 0.2 seconds. STARTING AT 40.0 second
#    i.e. (540.0, 40.2, 40.4 ... up to 42 seconds)
#
#   The still images will be saved in a newly created directory
#   'STILL_IMAGES' within the input directory. (Make sure you have write
#   permission in the input directory)
