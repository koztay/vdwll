This is an example that shows the asynchronous method call support.

The server has a single method that has an artificial delay of three seconds
before it returns the result of the computation.

The client shows how you might use Pyro's asynchronous feature to run the remote
method call in the background and deal with the results later (when they
are available).

client_batch.py shows how to do asynchronous batched calls.
Notice how this is different from oneway batched calls because
we will get results this time (just somewhere in the future).
Oneway calls never return a result.

client_callchain.py shows the 'call chain' feature, where you can chain
one or more asynchronous function calls to be performed as soon as the
asynchronous call result became available. You can chain normal functions but
also more pyro calls. The result of the previous call is passed
to the next call as argument.
